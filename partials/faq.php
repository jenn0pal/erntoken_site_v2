                How to participate on ICO?
            </dt>
            <dd class="faq__answer">
                You can purchase ERN tokens using Ethereum (ETH). Upon sending ETH to smart contract address, you will automatically get ERN tokens, as well as applicable ETH bonus.

            <dd class="faq__answer">
                ERN tokens will automatically be sent to your MYETHERWALLET address after receiving your ETH deposit ad after confirmations from the blockchain.

            <dt class="faq__question"><span class="arrow left faq__arrow"></span>Why are you giving out ETH as a bonus instead of ERN?</dt>
            <dd class="faq__answer">
                This is to avoid too much ERN token supply floating in the market, which is the common reason for massive pumping and dumping of digital currencies once they hit the exchangers.

                The detailed timeline of our projects can be seen and reviewed on our roadmap. We can expect Listern Audio Platform and Minde Pocket Miner in early 2019.

            <dd class="faq__answer">
                Right after ICO, we will apply ERN to be listed on external exchangers. The ERN team, however, has decided to skip the internal exchange to avoid price manipulation.

            <dt class="faq__question"><span class="arrow left faq__arrow"></span>Will there be token locking?</dt>
            <dd class="faq__answer">
                All of the ERN tokens that can be bought during the ICO period and all the bonuses will be unlocked after ICO. This is to avoid premature selling of tokens during the ICO phase. After ICO is finished, you can already transfer your ERN tokens to any Ether Wallet address and possibly, on an exchanger. Meanwhile, ERN tokens allotted for the developers will be locked until 2020. Growth pool tokens, on the other hand, will be locked for six months.
